**The Given Project is an aim to implement Natural Language Toolkit text preprocessor techniques combined with implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm  to produce a Multi Class Classification model that is able to classify the messages or pieces of text onto two or more predefined Categories. The Model is deployed on to the Custom Android App which is separately build. Android app allowed us to use the model in Android phone and was instrumental in classfying the messages in various categories(Cabs,Personal,Food,Fashion etc) To serve the model as an operative for mobile phone , the message from the individual phones has been used for the training purposes**

* *Add_Label_Script(1).py and Add_Label_script.ipynb consist of the Working that had been done towards formation of model and preprocessing the training messages*


* *FinalApp.py the python file which is deployed onto the server where the model is constantly running wating for the messages  . The Model then sends the appropriate response detailing the prediction that it done of the incoming message*


* *FinalFile11.pkl is the file where the developed model has been freezed in binary form* 


* *Stopwords.txt and myfile3.txt, the text files which consist of the stopwords (common words ) in the english language and the messages we acquired from the individual phones towards formation of model respectively*

* *ReadSms Custom app build to extract out the text messages from personal android phones*

* *Sms Categroizer - A custom app build which sends every incoming messages to the phone  onto the server and by analyzing the response received shifts entire message to one category or another*
